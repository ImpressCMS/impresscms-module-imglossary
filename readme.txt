Introduction:
-------------
Thanks for giving imGlossary a chance. This little module has a single purpose: to help you build in your site a nice glossary, one in which you can choose to have a single category or many categories (glossaries).

This module was built using ImpressCMS 1.1 as test bed, and includes syntax that will probably need a not-too-old version of PHP. It's based on Wordbook 1.16, in turn based on Catzwolf's module called WF-FAQ, with many, many changes. But it does have a couple of good features: it uses Smarty templates and it's fully searchable (it even includes its own search function).

How to install
--------------
imGlossary is installed as a regular ICMS module, which means you should copy the complete 'modules/imglossary' folder into the '/modules' directory of your website. Then log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the imGlossary icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
